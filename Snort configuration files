# Custom Snort Rules

---

## Rule 1: Detect ICMP Ping Sweep
This rule detects a series of ICMP echo requests (pings) from a single host to multiple destinations, which may indicate a reconnaissance attempt.

```plaintext
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Sweep Detected"; itype:8; sid:1000001; rev:1; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 10;)
```

**Explanation:**
- **msg:** Message to display when the rule triggers.
- **itype:** Specifies ICMP type 8 (echo request).
- **threshold:** Triggers an alert if more than 5 echo requests are detected from the same source within 10 seconds.
- **sid:** Unique Snort ID for the rule.
- **rev:** Revision number of the rule.

## Rule 2: Detect Suspicious HTTP User-Agent
This rule flags HTTP requests with a suspicious User-Agent string often associated with malware or bots.

```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Suspicious HTTP User-Agent Detected"; flow:to_server,established; content:"User-Agent:"; http_header; content:"MaliciousBot"; http_header; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
- **flow:** Specifies that the rule only applies to traffic going to the server.
- **content:** Looks for "User-Agent:" and "MaliciousBot" in the HTTP headers.
- **http_header:** Ensures the content match applies to HTTP headers.
- **sid:** Unique Snort ID.
- **rev:** Revision number of the rule.

## Rule 3: Detect SMB Exploitation Attempt
This rule identifies potential SMB (Server Message Block) exploitation attempts targeting port 445.

```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 445 (msg:"Possible SMB Exploitation Detected"; content:"|FF|SMB"; offset:4; depth:4; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
- **content:** Searches for the SMB protocol header `FF SMB` in the packet payload.
- **offset:** Starts checking at the 4th byte.
- **depth:** Checks only the next 4 bytes.
- **sid:** Unique Snort ID.
- **rev:** Revision number.

## Rule 4: Detect DNS Data Exfiltration
This rule identifies unusually large DNS queries, which might indicate data exfiltration via DNS tunneling.

```plaintext
alert udp any any -> any 53 (msg:"Possible DNS Data Exfiltration"; content:"|03|www|07|example"; nocase; dsize:>200; sid:1000004; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
- **content:** Searches for a specific DNS query format, such as "www.example".
- **nocase:** Makes the content match case-insensitive.
- **dsize:** Alerts if the packet size is greater than 200 bytes.
- **sid:** Unique Snort ID.
- **rev:** Revision number.

## Rule 5: Detect SSH Brute Force Attempts
This rule detects multiple failed SSH login attempts from the same source.

```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 22 (msg:"SSH Brute Force Attempt"; flow:to_server,established; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 60; sid:1000005; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
- **flow:** Applies to traffic going to the server.
- **threshold:** Triggers an alert if 10 or more attempts are detected from a single source within 60 seconds.
- **sid:** Unique Snort ID.
- **rev:** Revision number.

---

### Notes
- Update `sid` values to ensure they do not conflict with existing Snort rules in your environment.
- Test these rules in a controlled environment before deploying them to production.
